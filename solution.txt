# 1. In this directory, create a new directory called star_wars. Example answer: mkdir star_wars
mkdir star_wars
# 2. In the star_wars folder, create two new directories: empire and rebellion (This can be done in two commands, but how would you do it in one?)
mkdir empire rebellion
# 3. Inside the empire directory, create a file called darth_vader.txt 
touch darth_vader.txt
# 4. Use the force (or your echo) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the darth_vader.txt file (Don’t remember how to do this? Use the ‘other force’, known as Google!)
echo "...heavy breathing..." > darth_vader.txt
# 5. Inside the empire directory, create a file called emperor_palpatine.txt
touch emperor_palpatine.txt
# 6. Inside the empire directory, create a directory called death_star
mkdir death_star
# 7. Move darth_vader.txt into the death_star
mv darth_vader.txt /Users/luis/sei321/labs/star_wars/star_wars/empire/death_star

# 1. Inside the `star_wars/rebellion` directory, (IN ONE COMMAND) create a file called princess_leia.txt with the text "Help me, Obi-Wan…You’re my only hope."
 echo "Help me, Obi-Wan…You’re my only hope." > princess_leia.txt
# 2. Create a file called obi_wan.txt in star_wars/rebellion

# 3. Create a file in star_wars/rebellion called luke_skywalker.txt
touch luke_skywalker.txt
# 4. Create a directory in star_wars/rebellion called millenium_falcon
mkdir  millenium_falcon
# 5. Inside the millenium_falcon, create two files: c and chewbacca.txt
touch c chewbacca.txt
# 6. Move luke_skywalker, obi_wan, and princess_leia into the millenium_falcon, respectively.
